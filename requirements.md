# Open Tabs Extension Requirements

This document will evolve as we build out the extension. It outlines the core features, UI concepts, and technical requirements for the "Open Tabs" Chrome extension.

## Vision
A visual, easily sorted tab manager with a drill-down interface, inspired by the best UI concepts from graphic design. The UI will be highly visual, supporting drag-and-drop and optimized for both desktop and mobile.

## Core Features (Initial)
- Save open tabs as objects with editable properties
- Group tabs visually on a canvas
- Drag-and-drop interface for sorting and organizing tabs/groups
- Each tab is an object with editable and inherited properties
- Track user interactions with each tab
- Visual representation of tabs on a canvas

## Planned Features (Next Steps)
- User accounts: create, manage, and switch between multiple accounts
- Save tabs, groups, and relationships under user accounts
- Create relationships between tabs and tab groups
- Mobile-friendly drag-and-drop UI
- Drill-down navigation for tab groups and relationships

## UI Concepts
- Highly visual, canvas-based interface
- Tab objects displayed as cards or thumbnails
- Drag-and-drop for sorting and grouping
- Editable tab properties (title, URL, notes, tags, etc.)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Technical Requirements
- Chrome extension (Manifest V3)
- Uses browser APIs for tab management
- Local storage for tab data (initially)
- Cloud sync and account management (future)
- Modular codebase for easy feature expansion

This requirements document will be updated as new features and ideas are added during development.
